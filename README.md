# Python-Challenge
- Creating Python scripts to analyze the records on the given `.csv` datasets.<br />

  ###### _Both python scripts need to generate txt. files while displaying the results in the terminal, and save them in a local folder. Therefore, at the end of coding, I output results as a list, and use loop to display, create and save the files._<br />
  
  Solution: 
  - import os and csv module to get the file path and be avle to read the file,
- Creating a text file that has the results from your analysis, and saving the file in a subfolder.
## PyBank
### Target
The given dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".
Your analysis should look similar to the following:

### The way to approach
- The total number of months.
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes.
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
## PyPoll
The givendataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate".
Your analysis should look similar to the following:

### The way to approach
- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote.
